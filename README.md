# Welcome to ML-medical-imaging-3011979
This is the repository for the learning materials from the **3011979: Machine Learning for Medical Imaging** course taught by our group at the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand.

Current contents are combined from Spring 2021 and Spring 2022. Lectures from Spring 2021 contents are more theoretical while lectures from Spring 2022 focus more on the practical side.

The slides and problem sets are all in English.

Recorded lecture videos are hosted on Echo360.

## What can you find here?
1. Lecture slides in PDF format
2. Compiled list of URLs for recorded videos (See below)
3. Problem sets and other assignments
4. Data and scripts for in-class demos
5. Python notebooks for the programming sessions
